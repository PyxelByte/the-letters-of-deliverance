# The Letters of Deliverance

This is the source code for our Ludum Dare 51 game, [The Letters of Deliverance](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/the-letters-of-deliverance).

## Description

The year is 2092<br>
And in the world is something new<br>
A man has made himself immortal<br>
Within a land that's far from normal<br>
He stands as awful oddity<br>
With all his bastard progeny<br>
A hundred fifty six his age<br>
Beyond the years of any sage<br>
His spirit lacks in wisdom whole<br>
He thinks that he is in control<br>
And yet tonight I reap his soul
